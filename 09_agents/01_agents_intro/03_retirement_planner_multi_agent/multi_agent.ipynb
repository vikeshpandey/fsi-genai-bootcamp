    "In this notebook, we will extend the concepts of agents to multi-agent systems. Using multiple agents allows us to create more specialized agents that can work together to solve complex problems. Unlike a single, jack-of-all-trades agent, multi-agent systems can be more efficient and effective at solving problems that require a variety of skills.\n",
    "In the example below, we'll build a investment and retirement planning system that uses multiple agents to help a user plan for their future. The system will be comprised of three agents:\n",
    "- Manager Agent: This agent will be responsible for creating the overall plan and delegating tasks to the other agents.\n",
    "- Investment Analysis Agent: This agent will be responsible for analyzing potential investments\n",
    "- Retirement Planning Agent: This agent will be responsible for analyzing whether retirement goals can be met given a investment and savings strategy.\n",
